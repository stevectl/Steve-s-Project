# Steve-s-Project

This is a project done during SUSS Year1.
Everything used within are in-built python codes. There are no other libraries required.

Running the main.py will create the whole Hotel object.
The construct of this application is as such:

Hotel objects contains:
  Booking object:
    Guest object
    Room object:
      Amenity object
      Bed object
      

main.py initializes all of these objects using the given .txt files

The hotel is able to create new bookings, search for bookings, cancel booking, and check in.

Only registered users in the .txt files are able to create the booking
